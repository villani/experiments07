experiments07
=============

Each ARFF base from Experiments04 are used for train and the nine remaining bases for test in the annotation medical images task. The difference those experiment to the preview experiment is that on Experiments07 the classification is realized by axis instead of assign the labels to all the axes in a only step like on Experiments06. The performance from various classifiers are evaluated to this task. The classifiers used are MLkNN, BRkNN, ClassifierChain(kNN), HMC(kNN) and LabelPowerset(kNN). Furthermore, an evaluating is realized about what  extraction features techniques provides more relevant features to the classifiers from this task.
